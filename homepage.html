          Founded by Gustaff Martinsson, in Målmo in 1985, the goal of Kjiarna has goal has always been to refine classic recipes and bring the traditional tastes of Sweden baking into the modern day. Gustaff's son, Markus, has carried on his fathers
          vision and brought it to new heights across Sweden and Scandanavia. After working in the original Kjiarna for most of his youth, Markus left Scandinavia for France, where he studied under some of the most renowned pastry chefs in the
          country. Upon his return, he brought this experience to Kjiarna, and introduced our now famous croissants and pain-au-chocolats.
